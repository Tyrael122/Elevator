A simple elevator made in C# using Windows Forms.

It has buttons to select the floor you want to go. When it arrives in a specified floor, it waits a bit to board and unboard passengers.

You can also press multiple floors, and it will follow a pre-designed order: it'll go from top to bottom.

I uploaded all files from the Visual Studio Folder.
